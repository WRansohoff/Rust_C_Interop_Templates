# Overview

Two tiny Rust template projects.

One demonstrates how to call a C function from Rust, the other how to call a Rust function from C.

Each template also has an example designed for a bare-metal STM32 target, but those are still in-progress. They should work, but they need polishing and I don't think they are very good examples of how you would actually want to structure these sorts of projects.
